I am new to Github  so i actually dont what to write here. But i am providing the refrences and process i used in this project.

I downloaded the png images of pipes and bird and background for flappybird from  https://github.com/clear-code-projects/FlappyBird_Python/tree/master/assets.

i first created the the game. then made and environment from it . for creating environment i took refrence from this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxXKISVkH6Y.

After this i created DQNAgent class for the agents. And finally call all the above functions to training the agents. I got suffiently good results after 150 episodes 
give or take. but it was unbeatable after 189 episodes of game. 

very nice game.
