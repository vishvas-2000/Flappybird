# Flappybird
Flappy bird game
I downloaded the png images of pipes and bird and background for flappybird from  https://github.com/clear-code-projects/FlappyBird_Python/tree/master/assets.
i first created the the game. then made and environment from it . for creating environment i tooki refrence from this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxXKISVkH6Y.
After this i created DQNAgent class for the agents. And finally call all the above functions to training the agents. I got suffiently good after 150 episodes 
give or take. but it was unbeatable after 189 episodes of game.
